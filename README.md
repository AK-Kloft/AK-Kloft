- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is the AK-Kloft GitHub account!

This account is intended to function as a shared library of code for the working-group. 
How we use it will be up to us members to adapt so it suits us, to keep it as simple and useful as possible. Here is a suggested workflow:

When you've created a script (for literally anything), go in here and check if anyone has posted something similar.
   - If yes - does your script do something theirs doesn't? In that case, upload yours and comment, very short and simple, what yours do differently.
   - If no - upload yours. Check if there already exists a folder that suits the main characteristics of youor script and, in that case, upload it there. 
             If there is no such folder, create a new one with the main theme, and upload your script there.


For the scripts to be easy to use for others, it's good to add some basic comments about the context. I would suggest:
  - Your name
  - The project
  - Date
  - Core characteristics of the script (e.g., GOF-plots of NONMEM output and GGplot plotting, or dataset formatting with Dplyr, or 2cmp model with IIV... etc)
  - The path to where files necessary for running the script are (such as a spreadsheet with data), or, uploading those directly into the same GitHub folder


When you create a folder and name a script, make sure the name is helpful for someone looking for a template. It is of course impossible to incorporate all useful
information in one name. But make sure the core characteristics, and what makes your script special, can be found in some very broad term. Then add either a separate
text file giving a bit more context and key-terms, or add that as comments in the beginning of the script.

This is intended to be as useful as possible, yet as simple as possible. Of course it is good coding practice to comment in your script, but you don't need to
make the script perfectly clean or explain everything like a tutorial. Upload the script you used and worked, only that in itself will be very useful to someone else
some other day! :)
